# Embedded_Linux

In this repository you will find:

- A first project (lab1): 
Creation of a Docker image built from a dockerfile that allowed me to install Crosstool-ng

- A second project(lab2):
Which consists in working with YOCTO and its recipe systems and meta-layers.

These first two projects were carried out using the git of our trainer in Linux-Embedded,
Yassine ELMERNISSI.

- A personal project(Router):
The creation of a wifi router intended to run on a Raspberry Pi 3
